## 1. Project Specification and Plan

### 1.1 Project Overview

**Project Motivation**

Financial institutions face increasing challenges in keeping up with rapidly evolving regulatory requirements issued by authorities such as the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the European Central Bank (ECB), and other governing bodies. For Greenlink Digital Bank (GLDB), a Digital Wholesale Bank licensed by MAS to serve the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) segment, manual tracking of regulatory changes is time-consuming, prone to oversight, and directly threatens the bank's core value proposition of near-instantaneous supply chain financing. Any delay in detecting and responding to regulatory changes could result in non-compliance penalties, operational disruptions, or loss of the DWB license.

This project addresses this critical business need by developing an automated regulatory monitoring and compliance management system that eliminates manual tracking, provides real-time regulatory intelligence, and equips compliance officers with actionable dashboards and workflow tools.

**Project Objectives**

- Automate the retrieval of regulatory updates from MAS via web scraping, with a phased expansion plan for other international regulatory bodies (FATF, FinCEN, ECB, FCA, BIS, HKMA).
- Detect and analyze changes in regulatory documents by comparing versions and recording semantic differences.
- Assess how new regulations affect existing compliance processes using LLM-powered impact analysis (Critical, High, Medium, Low) with keyword-based fallback.
- Provide automated alerts categorized by severity (Immediate Action Required, Review Recommended, Informational) and user-friendly dashboards for compliance teams.
- Maintain a centralized, searchable archive of all regulatory changes, LLM interactions, and corresponding staff actions for audit purposes.
- Implement PII guardrails to prevent personal identification information from being processed or stored by the system.
- Deliver a working Proof of Concept (POC) focused initially on MAS regulations, with a phased expansion plan for other regulatory bodies.

**Phased Implementation Approach (per industry partner feedback)**

Following guidance from GLDB's industry partner (Patrick), the project adopts a phased approach:
- Phase 1 (Current): Focus on MAS regulations and sample Policy & Procedure Manuals (PMPs) for validation
- Phase 2 (Future): Expand to FATF, FinCEN, ECB, FCA, BIS, HKMA
- Phase 3 (Future): SharePoint integration for automatic internal policy retrieval

**Project Scope**

The system covers 9 functional modules:

1. Regulatory Feed Integration (MAS web scraping with fallback data)
2. Change Detection (biweekly automated scanning)
3. Impact Assessment (LLM-powered risk analysis with keyword fallback)
4. Notification and Alert System (severity-categorized alerts)
5. Knowledge Base Management (regulations + policies CRUD)
6. Compliance Gap Analysis (regulation-to-policy comparison)
7. Task and Workflow Management (assignment, deadlines, tracking)
8. Historical Archive and Audit Trail (searchable, filterable logs)
9. Reporting and Dashboards (charts, trends, print-friendly reports)

**Deliverables:**
- Working web application (Node.js backend + decoupled HTML/JS frontend)
- MySQL database with 9 normalized tables
- Automated feed integrator service (MAS web scraping)
- RAG pipeline with Chroma vector database and OpenAI embeddings
- PII detection and filtering service (PDPA compliance)
- Project documentation and report

**Project Assumptions**

- The system operates on localhost during development; deployment to a production server is planned for a later phase.
- Regulatory source websites (MAS, FATF, etc.) maintain their current HTML structure. If a site changes its layout, the scraper falls back to cached reference data.
- All team members have access to Node.js (v18+), MySQL, and the shared Azure database server.
- The system is designed as a Proof of Concept (POC) for demonstration purposes; production-grade features such as JWT session tokens, rate limiting, and HTTPS are out of scope for this phase.
- The industry partner (GLDB) will provide sample Policy & Procedure Manuals (PMPs) for validation of the compliance gap analysis module.
- LLM (Large Language Model) integration uses the OpenAI API for impact assessment and regulatory-to-policy comparison. API costs are managed within the free/trial tier.
- PII (Personal Identification Information) must not be uploaded to or processed by the LLM. Guardrail mechanisms will filter sensitive data before LLM calls.

### 1.2 Functional Requirements

**FR1: Regulatory Feed Integration**
The system must connect to external regulatory databases, central banks, and government portals (primarily MAS for Phase 1, with expansion to FATF, FinCEN, ECB, FCA, BIS, and HKMA in Phase 2) via web scraping to retrieve regulatory updates. It must parse the retrieved HTML data using axios and cheerio, perform duplicate detection against existing records, and store new regulations in the internal MySQL knowledge base with source attribution, category classification, and version tracking. The system includes fallback reference data to ensure continuity when live sources are unreachable.

**FR2: Automated Change Detection**
The system must automatically scan for updates in regulatory documents and advisories approximately every two weeks using a node-cron scheduled job. When a regulation with a higher version number is detected, the system must record the version change in the regulation_changes table along with a description of the semantic differences between the old and new versions.

**FR3: Impact Assessment and Risk Scoring**
The system must analyze each new or updated regulation to determine its impact on GLDB compliance processes using LLM-powered content analysis (OpenAI GPT). The system must assign an impact score of Critical, High, Medium, or Low based on the LLM's semantic understanding of the regulation's content, context, and implications for GLDB's operations. A keyword-based fallback mechanism shall be available when the LLM is unavailable. Impact data must be displayed in a dedicated dashboard view with color-coded severity cards and prioritized sorting.

**FR4: Notification and Alert Management**
The system must automatically generate alerts categorized by severity (Immediate Action Required, Review Recommended, Informational) when new regulations are ingested or existing regulations are updated. Compliance officers must be able to view alerts with color-coded severity badges, filter alerts by severity level and status using client-side filtering, and update alert status (Unread, Read, Dismissed) directly from the dashboard.

**FR5: Knowledge Base Management**
The system must maintain a centralized knowledge base of all ingested regulations with source attribution, version history, and category classification. Compliance officers must be able to view, add, and edit regulations and internal policies through the dashboard.

**FR6: Compliance Gap Analysis**
The system must allow compliance officers to identify and record compliance gaps between new regulatory requirements and existing internal bank policies. Each gap must be linked to a specific regulation and policy, with a status lifecycle of Open, In Review, and Remediated.

**FR7: Task and Workflow Management**
The system must allow compliance officers to create tasks for relevant departments with task assignment to specific users, deadline setting, optional linking to related alerts, and progress tracking through a status lifecycle of Pending, In Progress, and Completed. Tasks with deadlines within 3 days or past due must be visually highlighted.

**FR8: Historical Archive and Audit Trail**
The database must maintain a fully searchable archive of every regulatory change detected. The system must record all actions taken by GLDB staff in an audit_logs table with user attribution, action type, target table, target identifier, description, and timestamp. The audit trail must also capture all LLM interactions including the input prompt, output response, target regulation/policy, and processing timestamp. Compliance officers must be able to filter audit logs by user, action type, target table, and date range.

**FR9: Reporting and Dashboards**
The system must provide a professional, multi-view dashboard with sidebar navigation across 10 views. The Reports view must display regulatory changes summarized by category in a table, alert trends over time in a Chart.js line chart, severity distribution in a pie chart, impact distribution in a doughnut chart, task status in a bar chart, and compliance status indicators with a progress bar.

**FR10: PII Detection and Filtering**
The system must implement a PII (Personal Identification Information) detection filter that scans all text content before it is sent to the LLM or stored in the database. The filter must detect Singapore NRIC/FIN numbers (pattern: [STFGM]\d{7}[A-Z]), phone numbers, email addresses, physical addresses, and personal names. When PII is detected, the system must block the content from being transmitted to the LLM, log the detection event in the audit trail, and return an appropriate error message to the user. This ensures compliance with PDPA (Personal Data Protection Act) requirements and prevents sensitive data leakage to third-party AI services.

**FR11: LLM Interaction Audit Logging**
The system must log every interaction with the LLM (OpenAI API) in the audit trail for full traceability. Each log entry must record: the timestamp of the call, the input prompt sent to the LLM (with any PII-filtered content noted), the full response received from the LLM, the regulation or policy being analyzed, the resulting impact score or gap assessment, and the processing duration. This audit trail must be queryable through the existing audit log interface and satisfies MAS requirements for explainability and accountability in AI-assisted decision-making.

**Business Rules**

BR1 (Alert Categorization): All incoming regulatory alerts must be strictly categorized into one of three severity levels: Immediate Action Required, Review Recommended, or Informational.

BR2 (Audit Immutability): The audit_logs table must act as an append-only ledger. Past compliance actions and historical regulation versions cannot be overwritten or deleted.

BR3 (Compliance Gap Identification): New regulatory requirements must be systematically compared against GLDB's existing internal policies to highlight outdated, missing, or non-compliant areas.

BR4 (Duplicate Prevention): The system must not insert duplicate regulations. Before inserting, the system must check for an existing record with the same title and source.

BR5 (Impact-to-Severity Mapping): Critical and High impact scores must generate Immediate Action Required alerts. Medium impact must generate Review Recommended alerts. Low impact must generate Informational alerts.

BR6 (Task Deadline Escalation): Tasks with deadlines within 3 calendar days or past due must be visually flagged as urgent.

BR7 (Regulatory Source Resilience): If a live regulatory source is unreachable, the system must gracefully fall back to cached reference data and continue processing remaining sources.

BR8 (Alert Status Validation): Alert status updates must only accept Unread, Read, or Dismissed. Task status must only accept Pending, In Progress, or Completed. Gap status must only accept Open, In Review, or Remediated.

BR9 (Scheduled Scanning Interval): The automated feed integration must execute on a biweekly schedule and also run immediately upon system startup.

BR10 (PII Guardrails): No personally identifiable information (NRIC numbers, personal names, phone numbers, physical addresses) shall be transmitted to external LLM services or stored in regulation content fields. The system must scan and block PII before any LLM API call.

BR11 (LLM Traceability): Every LLM API call must be recorded in the audit_logs table with full input/output content, enabling compliance officers and auditors to review AI-assisted decisions at any time.

## 2. Business Analysis

### 2.1 Business Issues

**Current Business Situation**

Greenlink Digital Bank (GLDB) operates as an inaugural holder of the Digital Wholesale Bank (DWB) license issued by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and is purpose-built to serve the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprise (MSME) segment and the broader supply chain ecosystem. GLDB's core value proposition is "Supply Chain Finance 2.0," which heavily relies on the "Speed of Execution" to provide near-instantaneous financing for MSME invoices. To maintain this agility, GLDB utilizes a cloud-native, API-first architecture designed for rapid integration with B2B marketplaces and logistics platforms. As a primary facilitator for businesses operating in the China-Singapore corridor, GLDB must continuously navigate and adhere to a complex landscape of cross-border trade laws, green finance (ESG) mandates, and evolving regulations from authorities such as MAS, FATF, FinCEN, and the ECB.

**The Difficulties and Business Issues to Solve**

The primary business issue is that financial institutions face increasing challenges in keeping up with these rapidly evolving regulatory requirements, largely because the manual tracking of these regulatory changes is highly time-consuming and prone to oversight. For GLDB, these manual bottlenecks present a critical threat to their entire operational model. Relying on slow, manual compliance checks and updates leads to delays in internal processes, which directly contradicts their promise of near-instantaneous financing and fast MSME onboarding.

Furthermore, as a DWB license holder, GLDB operates under very strict regulatory guardrails, such as being restricted from taking retail deposits and facing limitations on certain lending activities compared to full banks. Any human oversight in tracking these complex MAS updates or high-impact changes could result in immediate risk or severe penalties. Ultimately, the business issue we are trying to solve is the dangerous bottleneck created by manual regulatory monitoring, which threatens GLDB's competitive advantage in execution speed and risks non-compliance with strict digital banking regulations.

### 2.2 Market Analysis

**Size of Business and Market Segment**

The global RegTech market was valued at USD 15.80 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach USD 85.92 billion by 2032, representing a CAGR of 23.6% (Fortune Business Insights). Singapore hosts 354,600 MSMEs representing 99.6% of all enterprises and contributing 47.3% to GDP (Department of Statistics Singapore, 2024). GLDB is one of 5 Digital Bank license holders in Singapore (3 Digital Full Banks: GXS Bank, MariBank, Trust Bank; 2 Digital Wholesale Banks: ANEXT Bank, Green Link Digital Bank). Singapore ranks 4th globally in the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 39, Z/Yen Group, 2026).

**Competitive Analysis**

| Solution | Type | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|----------|------|-----------|------------|
| Manual Compliance Teams | In-house | Deep institutional knowledge | Slow, expensive, error-prone |
| Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence | Commercial SaaS | Comprehensive global coverage | Expensive enterprise pricing |
| Wolters Kluwer OneSumX | Commercial SaaS | End-to-end regulatory reporting | High implementation cost |
| Our System (GLDB POC) | Custom-built | Tailored to GLDB's exact sources, LLM-powered analysis, zero licensing cost, API-first | POC stage, expanding to full coverage |

### 2.3 Business Solutions

**Process Flow**

The current manual compliance process at GLDB involves compliance officers manually visiting regulatory websites, reading through documents, identifying changes, and updating internal procedures. This process is reactive, slow, and prone to human error.

Our automated system transforms this into a proactive, real-time pipeline:

1. **Automated Ingestion:** The feedIntegrator.js service scrapes the MAS regulatory website every 14 days (and on server startup), automatically retrieving new regulatory data. Fallback reference data ensures continuity when the live source is unreachable.
2. **Change Detection:** The system compares scraped regulation versions against stored versions, recording any changes with semantic difference descriptions.
3. **Impact Assessment:** Each change is automatically analyzed using LLM (OpenAI GPT) to determine its impact on GLDB's operations, scoring it as Critical/High/Medium/Low based on semantic understanding of the regulatory text. A keyword-based fallback is used when the LLM is unavailable.
4. **Alert Generation:** Alerts are auto-created with severity levels, appearing immediately on the compliance officer's dashboard.
5. **Task Assignment:** Compliance officers create and assign tasks to team members with deadlines, tracking progress through to completion.
6. **Gap Analysis:** Officers compare new regulations against internal policies, flagging gaps for remediation.
7. **Audit Trail:** Every action is logged automatically, providing a searchable archive for regulatory inspections.

**How IT Helps**

The IT solution eliminates the manual bottleneck by automating the entire regulatory monitoring lifecycle. Instead of compliance officers spending hours manually checking websites, the system does it automatically and presents only actionable intelligence. This reduces response time from days to seconds, ensures no regulatory change is missed, and provides audit-ready documentation that satisfies MAS inspection requirements.

```

**Backend Layer:** Node.js/Express server exposing 25+ RESTful API endpoints returning raw JSON. Routes are organized into 9 separate modules under the routes/ directory for clean separation of concerns. Authentication uses bcryptjs for password hashing. A shared audit logging middleware automatically records user actions.

**Frontend Layer:** Completely separate application in the frontend/ directory built with plain HTML, Bootstrap 5 CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Communicates with the backend exclusively through fetch() HTTP requests. Uses Chart.js (loaded via CDN) for data visualization. No frontend frameworks or build tools.

**Automation Layer:** The feedIntegrator.js background service runs inside the Node.js process, triggered by node-cron on a biweekly schedule. It scrapes the MAS regulatory website using axios and cheerio, performs duplicate detection, RAG-powered impact assessment (using Chroma vector search + OpenAI GPT-4o-mini), and auto-generates alerts and change records. A PII filter scans all content before LLM processing to ensure PDPA compliance. All LLM interactions are logged in the audit trail for traceability. Fallback reference data is used when the live MAS website is unreachable.

**Database:** MySQL with 9 normalized tables (users, regulatory_sources, regulations, regulation_changes, alerts, internal_policies, compliance_gaps, tasks, audit_logs) hosted on Azure (dft-fyp.mysql.database.azure.com). All tables use foreign key constraints for referential integrity.

**Technology Stack:**

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Runtime | Node.js | Server-side JavaScript |
| Framework | Express.js | RESTful API routing |
| Database | MySQL + mysql2 | Persistent storage with connection pooling |

## 6. Conclusions

The Automated Regulatory Monitoring and Compliance Management System successfully addresses the core business problem of manual regulatory tracking at Greenlink Digital Bank. The system automates the entire compliance monitoring lifecycle — from data ingestion through MAS web scraping (Phase 1 POC), to RAG-powered change detection, LLM impact assessment, alert generation, and compliance workflow management.

Key achievements:
- Built a fully functional 9-module compliance platform with 25+ REST API endpoints
- Implemented automated web scraping from MAS regulatory website with fallback data (Phase 1 POC)
- Developed a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline using Chroma vector database and OpenAI text-embedding-3-small for semantic search
- Integrated LLM-powered impact assessment (GPT-4o-mini) for intelligent regulatory analysis
- Implemented PII detection and filtering (NRIC, phone, email, postal codes, credit cards, passports) for PDPA compliance
- Developed a professional 10-view dashboard with login authentication, dark mode, pagination, Chart.js visualizations, CSV export, and print-friendly reports
- Achieved clean code separation with modular route files, shared middleware, and externalized configuration
- Deployed the database to Azure for team collaboration
- Implemented comprehensive audit logging of all user actions and LLM interactions for MAS traceability requirements

The system demonstrates that automated compliance monitoring is not only technically feasible for a Digital Wholesale Bank but is an operational necessity. By replacing manual regulatory tracking with an automated pipeline, GLDB can maintain its competitive advantage in execution speed while ensuring continuous compliance with MAS and international regulatory requirements.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Role-based access control with restricted views per role (Admin, Compliance Officer, Internal Auditor)
- Email/SMS notifications for Critical alerts
- Session management with JWT tokens and auto-logout after inactivity
- Deployment to a production cloud server with HTTPS
- Expansion from MAS-focused POC to full multi-regulatory coverage (FATF, FinCEN, ECB, FCA, BIS, HKMA)
- SharePoint integration for automatic retrieval of latest internal Policy & Procedure Manuals
- Date range filtering for reports and audit trail
- Real-time WebSocket notifications for new alerts

**Industry Partner Feedback (Meeting with Patrick, GLDB):**
- Confirmed all 9 functional requirements are aligned with GLDB's needs
- Recommended phased approach: start with MAS regulations and sample PMPs before expanding
- Suggested integrating LLMs for analysis and comparison (multiple models may be needed)
- Emphasized PII guardrails and audit trail for LLM usage
- Offered to provide sample PMPs for validation
- Agreed the initial goal is a working POC/pilot, not a complete product
- Suggested future SharePoint integration for automatic knowledge base updates
